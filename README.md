## :memo: Notes

### 1. OnTouch Events
This is the first project where I have used onTouch events for mobile webapps. If you're new too, here are some notes that may assist you on your journey.

Useful resources: [React Long Press Event](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48048957/react-long-press-event)

### 2. SerializableError: Error serializing
Found the isSerializable error a few times with this Nextjs project. A quick solution that worked for this use case was to add " || null" to return items in getStaticProps. Specifically for date format or number format objects.

For further reading on the subject see:
   - [getServerSideProps cannot be serialized as JSON. Please only return JSON serializable data types](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/11993)
   - [Error: How to serialize data from getStaticProps : Next.js](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66106776/error-how-to-serialize-data-from-getstaticprops-next-js)
