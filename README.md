### :lady_beetle: Bugs and Known Issues

React v18 Strict Mode causes Redux to run 2x when component mounts for the first time, resulting in all records duped on the frontend. I tried unsuccessfully to create a workaround. Options for now are:
  - Don't use Strict Mode
  - Downgrade to React 17.

Possible FIX: load the API posts data immediately when the app loads.

   :heavy_check_mark: `store.dispatch(fetchPosts())` added to index.js

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* You need this
* And you need this
* Oh, and don't forget this

### Installation

_Easily set up a local development environment_

 - clone or download zip file
 - cd into root
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`


## Usage

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Deployment

Additional notes on how to deploy this on a live or release system. Explaining the most important branches, what pipelines they trigger and how to update the database (if anything special).

### Server

* Live:
* Release:
* Development:

This project is hosted on Netlify. To deploy your own copy, you will need to set up a Netlify account.

Before deploying to Netlify you need to create a build:

```
$ npm run build
```

It is a good idea to test your build by serving it on your localhost. Once you are happy with your build, open up your Netlify Account.

For a basic deploy, you can simply drag and drop the build folder onto your Netlify Sites directory. See [Get started with Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/) for details.

## :memo: Notes

### 1. OnTouch Events
This is the first project where I have used onTouch events for mobile webapps. If you're new too, here are some notes that may assist you on your journey.

Useful resources: [React Long Press Event](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48048957/react-long-press-event)

### 1. SerializableError: Error serializing
Found the isSerializable error a few times with this Nextjs project. A quick solution that worked for this use case was to add " || null" to return items in getStaticProps. Specifically for date format or number format objects.

For further reading on the subject see:
   - [getServerSideProps cannot be serialized as JSON. Please only return JSON serializable data types](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/11993)
   - [Error: How to serialize data from getStaticProps : Next.js](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66106776/error-how-to-serialize-data-from-getstaticprops-next-js)
